# wafer_fault_detection_1
### Problem Statement
 The inputs of various sensors for different wafers have been provided. In electronics, a wafer(also called a slice or substrate) is a thin slice of semiconductor used for the fabrication of integrated circuts.
 The goal is to build a machine learning model which predicts whether a wafer needs to be replaced or not(ie; whether it is working or not) based of the inputs from various sensors.
 There are two classes : +1 and -1
 - +1 means that the wafer is in a working condition and it doesn't need to be replaced.
 - -1 means that the wafer is faulty and it needs to be replaced.
